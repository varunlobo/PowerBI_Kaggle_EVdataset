# PowerBI_Kaggle_EVdataset

The dataset was obtained from kaggle. I was curious to see what are the current capabilities of EV especially the range, charging times, torque and acceleration. 
I was not surprised to see Porsche and Tesla having an avg acceleration 0-100 kmph of around 4 sec, which was the fastest in the dataset. 
Also, I had not thought about battery performance during different weather conditions. Looks like mileage is lower during cold seasons on both, city and highway driving.
